npm install can take an awefull long time mand you are confused most time as i it might take some dependencies up to 8hrs to install while your tutorial takes less than 3mins 

try:
npm set progress=false

try:
npm config set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/

try:
npm config rm proxy
npm config rm https-proxy

if all of this does not work 

try:
npm install -g pnpm

the last step is definatly going to work as it does not use the same depencies as npm and can be much more faster, share what works for you.
